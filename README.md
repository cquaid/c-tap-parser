c-tap-parser
============

This is a running project to impliment a TAP::Parser stype library for C.

The makefile is pretty useless right now.  `make testprog` will build the testprog,
which acts like a decently useable tap harness for single test files.

For reference test.c and tap_parser.h are probably the best guide to using this.
